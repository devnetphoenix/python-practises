# python-practises
This repo is the personal practises of mine and doesnot contain detailed, coments about 
approaches taken. 

These can't be considered optimal solutions of the problem these codes are solving.

Later this repo will be updated with many codes and probaly they will be the optimal solutons of the question they will be solving.

This repo is for practise purpose.
One can take reference for the codes.
